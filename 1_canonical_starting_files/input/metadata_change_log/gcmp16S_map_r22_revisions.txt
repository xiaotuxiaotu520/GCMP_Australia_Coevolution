v22 (20160819): 

added columns 'host_name', 'host_genus', and 'host_species', which represent our current host taxonomy, as opposed to the taxonomy that we thought the samples were in the field.

changed 'field_host_clade_sensu_fukami' and 'field_host_clade_sensu_fukami_numeric' to 'host_clade_sensu_fukami' and 'host_clade_sensu_fukami_numeric'

Taxonomic changes include:
	migrating all Pacific 'Favias' to Dipsastraea
	splitting Seriatopora caliendrum into S. caliendrum and S. hystrix
	changing single 'Favites sp.' sample from E1 to 'Echinophyllia orpheensis'
	changing 'Mycedium' from WA to 'Echinophyllia aspera'. 

Taxonomic revisions caused changes to propagate through higher taxonomic columns and CTDB data, including the Darling functional groups of S. hystrix and E. orpheensis. 



v21: added Cartagena and Hawaii

v20:

Added missing data:
Added missing E3 size information from Projects/Expedition_Data/E3_Lizard_Island_2015/raw_metadataAustralia - January and February 2015 - Sample Data_2015-03-19

Added columns:
colony_width_max
	=max("colony_width1","colony_width2")

prop_max_diameter
	=(colony_width_max/Colony_maximum_diameter)

Colony_maximum_GCMP_recorded
	this is the maximum size recorded in the mapping for each species

Colony_maximum_diameter_universal
	=max(Colony_maximum_GCMP_recorded,Colony_maximum_diameter)
