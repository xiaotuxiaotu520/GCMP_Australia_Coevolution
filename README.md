# GCMP_Australia_Coevolution
Code and intermediate data files for the Global Coral Microbiome Project's Study of coral-microbe cophylogeny in Australia.

A full version of all code, intermediate data files, and results can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/icij16po86x6lo2/AAAs_7FN7aIbZtqszrH576kDa?dl=0

The prefix on each directory (0_, 1_) reflects a step in the analysis process.  The directory for each step has an input, output, and procedure folder. The scripts in the procedure folder can be run on the input folder to generate the output. 

This GitHub archive contains just the scripts (iPython notebooks, R scripts, or .sh files) for each analytical step. All analytical steps were conducted in either QIIME1.9 or in R. Large input files, of which there are several, are not included directly in the GitHub repository and need to be downloaded from the above link and added to the input folders. Note also that the code here is a superset of analyses used in the manuscript (code for some analayses that were not persued further is also available).
